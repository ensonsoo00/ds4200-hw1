      Hello! My name is Enson Soo, and I'm from New York City. I am currently a fourth year at Northeastern University, 
      studing data science and math. I am a former data engineer co-op at Guy Carpenter and Priceline. I was also 
      a teaching assistant and peer tutor for a math course (MATH 1365) and computer science course (CS 3000) at Northeastern University.
